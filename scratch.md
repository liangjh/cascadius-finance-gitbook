# Scratch

**Foundational**

* q: what "currency" is used to pay loans + distribute funds?
* stablecoins as an on-ramp from traditional to defi world?   using some other fluctuating token might not be acceptable
* no chain-specific currencies, or weird to translate from one chain to another
* chain specific ccys are for gas, i.e. facilitate transactions
* q: how to handle stablecoins (or non-native coins) in treasury?  operationally, how to do this?
  * stored in stablecoin contract, we'll need to keep records of each transaction, as well as the protocol's treasury

**Structuring**

* Rewards for structuring entities, i.e. yield ? &#x20;
* Via: (a) over-collateralization, or (b)&#x20;
* What to price the pools at?  i.e. face value of the loan principal? &#x20;

**Tokenomics**

* why (or why not) create a currency for the protocol?
* governance, financing
* work out what this means, have no idea what this entails
