# Cascadius | Securitized RWAs

Efficient capital markets facilitate the flow of capital between investors and borrowers.  Securitization, a major innovation in capital markets over the last several decades, enabled financial institutions (i.e. banks) to transfer risk off balance sheets and  investors to participate in the risks and returns of assets at scale.  This transfer of risk and capital has facilitated tremendous growth, investment, and ownership in society.

Cascadius Finance aims to build a full-stack securitization protocol and mechanism on-chain.  By facilitating the seamless transfer of risk and capital through structures already familiar to traditional institutional investors, we aim to accelerate the onboarding of mainstream investors into DeFi.

Cascadius implements the following:

* Proxied Loans: tokenized proxies for loans and lending products backed by real assets on EVM-compatible blockchains as ERC-721 compatible tokens with common attributes. &#x20;
* Asset Universe / Marketplace: a public catalog of assets on the platform (both existing and historic) that are offered to be placed into securitization vehicles.
* Structuring: mechanisms to allow institutional participants to create pools of loans that can be bundled into securitizations and optionally tranched to target diverse risk preferences, which will be ERC-20 compatible.&#x20;
* Quantitative Analytics: provide issuer and pool-level historic performance data.  Provide pricing toolkits to democratize cash flow scenarios on securitization structures with standard quantitative inputs utilized widely by TradFi securitized product investors.&#x20;

The Cascadius platform will be built to run on any EVM-compatible blockchain. &#x20;
